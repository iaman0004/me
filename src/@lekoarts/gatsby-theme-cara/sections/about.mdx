## About

##### My goal is to make the best use of my knowledge to solve problems programmaticlly

It all started with a dream to make things which was best for the welfare of society and the people.
I am an enthausiastic and passionate developer specialised in Web Technologies. I am still in my graduation phase and expecting to get out of it by the mid of `2021` . I want to build a bussiness out of my knowledge. I like playing football and other online games.
